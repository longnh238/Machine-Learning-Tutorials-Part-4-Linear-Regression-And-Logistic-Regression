# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 4: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 4: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression**, a beginner-friendly guide to two fundamental supervised learning algorithms used in machine learning. This tutorial covers the theory and practical implementation of both **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Introduction
In this part of the series, we focus on:
- **Linear Regression**: A method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.

Both algorithms are foundational in understanding how machine learning models predict continuous and categorical outcomes.

## Installation
To run the tutorials, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn and Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Tutorial Topics
1. **Introduction to Linear Regression**
   - The concept of regression and line fitting
   - Implementing Linear Regression in Python
   - Evaluating model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared
2. **Introduction to Logistic Regression**
   - Understanding the logistic function and how Logistic Regression works
   - Using Logistic Regression for binary classification
   - Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves
3. **Comparing Linear and Logistic Regression**
   - Differences and similarities
   - When to use each model
